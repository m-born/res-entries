Theories on credit vs currency

Currency is that which flows, which functions in 'currents'.
Following Michiel de Jong, this is the property that is the reason for the disassociation that materialises because of currency in economic interaction.
It is also the property that allows currency to flow out of ('weaker'?) system( node)s, and into such that bear more power/have more attraction.

In contrast, following de Jong, *Credit* is local / not delocalised, as it is given from one to an other.
